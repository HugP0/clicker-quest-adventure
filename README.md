# **Energy Evolution - A Clicker Game (Just Bored in Class)**

## **Project Description**

Welcome to *Energy Evolution*, a casual clicker game where the goal is to build and upgrade different types of power plants while managing their impact on the environment. The game starts with a simple coal power plant, and from there, you’ll be able to unlock solar, wind, nuclear, and other power plants to progress. The more plants you build, the more energy you generate, and the more visible the impact on the Earth becomes.

However, before you get too excited, **this project is just for fun**. I was bored in class and needed something to pass the time, so I decided to build a game as a way to practice coding (no serious objectives here). This project is a bit of an experiment, so don’t expect any groundbreaking features or professional polish—just a simple, no-frills game with some visual effects and energy management mechanics.

### **Features:**
- Click to generate energy and build various power plants (coal, solar, wind, etc.)
- Visual impact on the Earth’s environment depending on your choices (more pollution = darker skies).
- Basic upgrade system to improve energy production.
- Random events and achievements just for kicks.
- And yes, you can watch the Earth slowly transform as you play (if you care about that sort of thing).

### **Technologies Used:**
- HTML/CSS for the front-end (basic styling).
- JavaScript for game logic and functionality.
- Some basic animations and visual effects for fun.

### **Disclaimer:**
This project is **NOT a serious game**. It was made during a class because I was bored and needed a distraction. So, if you’re looking for something polished or groundbreaking, you might want to look elsewhere. I’m just here for the ride.
